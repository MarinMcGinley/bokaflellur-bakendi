# Bókaflellur backend

This is an Express backend to support the Bókaflellur blog website. It communicates with a simple postgresQL DB.

I made this project mainly because I wanted to learn more about NextJS v.13+ and wanted a simple backend for it to get me developing the front end as fast as possible.
